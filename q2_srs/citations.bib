ABSTRACT = {Several ecological data types, especially microbiome count data, are commonly sample-wise normalized before analysis to correct for sampling bias and other technical artifacts. Recently, we developed an algorithm for the normalization of ecological count data called &lsquo;scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS)&rsquo;, which surpasses the widely adopted &lsquo;rarefying&rsquo; (random subsampling without replacement) in reproducibility and in safeguarding the original community structure. Here, we describe an implementation of the SRS algorithm in the &lsquo;SRS&rsquo; R package and the &lsquo;q2-srs&rsquo; QIIME 2 plugin. We also provide accessory functions for dataset exploration to guide the choice of parameters for SRS.},
